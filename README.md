program goals:


	take a username as input

	return reddit data from that username, including subreddits that the user has been active in

	should state # of instances of each match it detects


	example:
```
		- /r/stims - 7 matches. (possible link to comment etc) 
		- /r/cracksmokers - 3 matches.
```
